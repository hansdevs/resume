# 🎮 Mini Game Thing

> A random collection of small web-based games.
> Made for fun. Built during moments of boredom at Starbucks

## 🧪 What Is This?

This is... something.
It might be a collection of games. Or experiments. Or button mashers.
Honestly, we’re figuring it out as we go. It’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript doing whatever they feel like.

## 🛠️ Built With

* `HTML` – structure-ish
* `CSS` – questionable styling
* `JavaScript` – the illusion of logic

No libraries (yet). No frameworks (yet). Just browser-friendly chaos.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mini-game-thing.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. ???
4. Fun (hopefully)

## 📝 Notes

* Made for boredom relief
* May evolve into something cool
* Or may sit here forever untouched
* Either way, it exists now
